## Project Background:
### Objective:
To analyze the impact of the CSW free bet campaign on sports betting activities, providing actionable insights to optimize future campaigns.
### Overview: 
I analyzed sports betting activities including YTD aggregated betting activities before the CSW free bet offer was given, betting activities during and one week after the campaign week, and compared players' betting patterns with real money and free bets, GGR trends, and first-time deposit trends related to new users and activation of inactive players. 
### Goals:
- Provided insights and recommendations tied to data findings to help marketing teams better align the next few months' marketing campaigns to the company’s goal.  
  - Mitigate risks such as negative gross gaming revenue 
  - Better tailor campaigns to reactivate inactive players, improve user acquisition, and retention, and ROI on commercial spending.
  - Built a high-level interactive dashboard to help Executives, and stakeholders monitor campaign KPIs.
### Deliverables: 
- I delivered tailored insights for top Executives, marketing, and commercial team stakeholders.
- Built an interactive Power BI dashboard with hierarchical row-level security providing various report access for stakeholders to monitor trends and KPIs.

## Data Structure: 

- *Players Segment*: This dataset provides the player ID for all players offered freebet and the amount of freebet given.

- *Jan_Oct8_ Activities*: Each record represents aggregated betting activities of players from January to October, a day before the free bet campaign, outlined bet counts, bonus stakes, bonus winnings, profit margin, stakes, and GGR, this gives us a YTD total of different KPIs

- *Oct_Activities*: This dataset provides insights into aggregating individual players' betting activities in October, including first-time deposit, and date, last deposit amount and date, GGR, withdrawal, stakes, and total deposit per player in October

- *Oct9-20_Activities*: Information about players' betting activities in campaign week and immediate post-campaign week, give insights into bet counts, bonus stakes, bonus winnings, profit margin, stakes, and GGR, help us to understand the betting patterns in the campaign week and track inactive players conversion

Data cleaning, transformation, merging, and modeling were conducted in Power Query(Power BI) for granularity reporting and data visualization.

## Executive summary: 
The campaign spanned October 9th to 13th, during which free bets were distributed to both YTD active and inactive players, the company did **₦2.75M** GGR in the campaign week, and less than **2.5%** of the **431** FTDs recorded in the campaign week came from players offered free bets, which means the free bet drove new user acquisition and converted first-time deposits of **₦1.31M** during the campaign week.  

Most of the bonus bets that linger into the post-campaign week cost the company **62%** of the **-₦28.6M** GGR big loss recorded. October recorded the highest FTDs count and deposit value at **₦4,899,509**, a **46.5%** increase from August 2024. While the campaign successfully drove new user acquisition and FTDs, it resulted in a significant revenue loss due to lingering bonuses, To mitigate risk in the future, wagering requirements should be implemented and disallow bonus usage to extend beyond promotional week.

## Conclusions and Recommendations:
### Conclusions: 
- *Success in New User Acquisition*: The campaign drove significant FTDs and new user registrations.
- *Revenue Loss*: Bonus bets contributed heavily to a **₦28.6M** loss post-campaign.
- *Low Conversion Among Free Bet Recipients*: Most free bet recipients did not deposit or engage meaningfully during the campaign.
- *Sustained Engagement Needed*: Retention rates among free bet recipients were very low, highlighting the need for better follow-up strategies.

### Recommendations:
- *Refine Target Audience*: Focus free bet offers on players segments with a higher likelihood of conversion, such as players with prior deposits or moderate activity levels and new users.
- *Optimize Bonus Structures*: Implement wagering requirements for bonus usage to mitigate potential revenue losses.
- *Diversify Incentives*: Introduce tiered rewards like loyalty points or cashback incentives to attract and retain players without excessive bonus costs.
- *Post-Campaign Follow-Up*: Create personalized offers for new users who registered and deposited during and after the campaign to encourage sustained activity.
- *Track ROI Metrics*: Use insights from the dashboard to refine audience segmentation and predict future trends. Monitor the profitability of free bets and other promotional activities more closely using tailored KPIs.

## Technical Details: 
- *DAX Query*: Calculations for GGR, FTDs, free bet used, and given target and retention metrics were implemented using DAX.
- *Data Modelling*: Tables were linked through Power BI’s relationship manager, ensuring seamless data integration for reporting.
- *Data Visualization*: An interactive dashboard was created to provide actionable insights and real-time tracking of future campaign success.
- *Row Level Security*: Hierarchical access was implemented, granting tailored data access to the Executive, marketing, and commercial manager.

## Clarifying Questions, Assumptions, and Caveats
- One of the major caveats was the inability to distinguish between active and inactive players in the player segment table, with a record of each player offered a free bet and how much.
- Not having access to the previous month's existing players' activities, like GGR and stakes, deprived us of the opportunity to compare staking trends between regular week and campaign weeks and to know what effect the campaign has on existing users.
